## Overview

In Magento, the basic components of page design are layouts, containers, and blocks. A layout represents the structure of a web page (1). Containers represent the placeholders within that web page structure (2). And blocks represent the UI controls or components within the container placeholders (3). These terms are illustrated and defined below.

## Practice

```

    -> Student1
    -> Student2
    -> ---
-> Teacher2
    -> StudentN
    -> ---
